# 📚 Panini Live Wishlist  

Easily create and share a **live-updating** wishlist for your Panini comics!  

## 🚀 Why?  

Panini only allows wishlist sharing via email, and once sent, the list quickly becomes outdated. If you buy a comic, your previously shared wishlist doesn't reflect the change.  

To solve this, I created a website that generates a **sharable live link** to your wishlist, ensuring it's always up to date!

# Panini live wishlist
Create a Sharable Link for your paninin Wishlist

## why?
Trough Panini you can only Share your wishlist via Email and then its not updated live. So if I buy a comic the wishlist I send to someone gets outdated.
Because I wanted to have a Link I can share I created this website.

## ToDo

[] Ability to Delete saved Account
[] Ability to change the URL Ending of your account
[] Ability to change Password of your account
