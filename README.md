# 📚 Panini Live Wishlist  

Easily create and share a **live-updating** wishlist for your Panini comics!  

## 🚀 Why?  

Panini only allows wishlist sharing via email, and once sent, the list quickly becomes outdated. If you buy a comic, your previously shared wishlist doesn't reflect the change.  

To solve this, I created a website that generates a **sharable live link** to your wishlist, ensuring it's always up to date!
